## Why Search Matters for AI Agents

AI models have knowledge cutoffs. To answer questions about current events, recent documentation, or real-time data, they need search capabilities.

**Common use cases:**
- Current news and events
- Latest documentation
- Fact verification
- Research assistance

---

## Option 1: SearXNG (Self-Hosted)

[SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) is a privacy-respecting metasearch engine you host yourself.

### How It Works

Aggregates results from multiple search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc.) without tracking users.

### Setup

```bash
# Docker deployment
docker run -d \
  --name searxng \
  -p 8888:8080 \
  -v "${PWD}/searxng:/etc/searxng" \
  searxng/searxng:latest
```

Or use the install script:
```bash
cd /usr/local
sudo git clone https://github.com/searxng/searxng.git
sudo searxng/utils/searxng.sh install all
```

### Pros
- ✅ Free (just server costs)
- ✅ Privacy-focused
- ✅ No API limits
- ✅ Aggregates multiple engines

### Cons
- ❌ Self-hosted (you maintain it)
- ❌ Can be blocked by search engines
- ❌ Requires technical setup

### Best For
- Privacy-conscious users
- Technical users comfortable with self-hosting
- High-volume search needs

---

## Option 2: Tavily (Managed)

[Tavily](https://tavily.com) is a search API specifically designed for AI agents.

### Features
- Optimized for LLM context windows
- Includes relevant snippets
- Source credibility scoring
- Structured JSON responses

### Pricing
- Free tier: 1,000 calls/month
- Pro: $0.025/call
- Enterprise: Custom

### Integration

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.tavily.com/search",
    json={
        "api_key": "your-api-key",
        "query": "latest AI developments",
        "search_depth": "basic",
        "include_answer": True
    }
)
```

### Pros
- ✅ Purpose-built for AI
- ✅ No infrastructure to maintain
- ✅ High-quality results
- ✅ Easy integration

### Cons
- ❌ Paid for high volume
- ❌ External dependency
- ❌ Rate limits on free tier

### Best For
- Production applications
- Teams without DevOps resources
- Quick prototyping

---

## Option 3: Custom Implementation

Build your own search pipeline.

### Architecture

```
User Query
    ↓
[Query Processing] → Expand keywords, detect intent
    ↓
[Multi-Source Search] → Google API, Bing API, News APIs
    ↓
[Result Aggregation] → Deduplicate, rank, filter
    ↓
[Content Extraction] → Fetch full pages, extract text
    ↓
[Response Generation] → Format for LLM context
```

### Components Needed

1. **Search APIs**
   - Google Custom Search API ($5/1000 queries)
   - Bing Search API ($7/1000 queries)
   - SerpAPI ($50/month unlimited)

2. **Content Extraction**
   - BeautifulSoup/Scrapy for HTML parsing
   - Newspaper3k for article extraction
   - Firecrawl for JavaScript-rendered pages

3. **Result Processing**
   - Deduplication (SimHash, MinHash)
   - Re-ranking (BM25, custom ML model)
   - Content summarization

### Pros
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ Customizable ranking
- ✅ No vendor lock-in

### Cons
- ❌ High development effort
- ❌ Maintenance overhead
- ❌ Multiple API integrations

### Best For
- Large-scale applications
- Specific domain requirements
- Teams with dedicated resources

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | SearXNG | Tavily | Custom |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Setup Complexity | Medium | Low | High |
| Ongoing Maintenance | Medium | None | High |
| Cost | Server only | Per-query | API costs |
| Privacy | Excellent | Good | Depends |
| Result Quality | Good | Excellent | Configurable |
| Rate Limits | None | Yes | API-dependent |
| AI Optimization | Manual | Built-in | Custom |

---

## My Recommendation

### For Personal/Experimentation
**SearXNG** – Free, private, good enough for most needs.

### For Production
**Tavily** – Purpose-built, reliable, worth the cost for serious applications.

### For Scale
**Custom** – When you have specific needs and engineering resources.

---

## Implementation Example: SearXNG with OpenClaw

```bash
# Add to TOOLS.md
curl -s "http://localhost:8888/search?q=QUERY&format=json" | \
  jq -r '.results[] | "\(.title)\n\(.url)\n\(.content)\n---"'
```

```python
# search.py wrapper
import requests
import sys

def search(query):
    url = "http://localhost:8888/search"
    params = {"q": query, "format": "json"}
    
    resp = requests.get(url, params=params)
    data = resp.json()
    
    for result in data.get("results", [])[:5]:
        print(f"**{result['title']}**")
        print(f"{result['url']}")
        print(f"{result['content'][:200]}...\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    search(" ".join(sys.argv[1:]))
```

## Conclusion

| Your Situation | Choose |
|----------------|--------|
| Budget-conscious, technical | SearXNG |
| Production, fast delivery | Tavily |
| Scale, specific requirements | Custom |

Start with SearXNG for experimentation. Move to Tavily when you need reliability without infrastructure work. Build custom only when you outgrow managed solutions.
